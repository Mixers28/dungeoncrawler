# NOW - Working Memory (WM)

> This file captures the **current focus / sprint**.  
> It should always describe what we're doing *right now*.

<!-- SUMMARY_START -->
**Current Focus (auto-maintained by Agent):**
- Validate Railway deploy from `dcv01` and monitor build warnings.
- Keep docs aligned with repo structure and story assets.
- Stabilize runtime behavior (cache limits, story loading, Supabase sessions).
<!-- SUMMARY_END -->

## Current Objective

Deploy Dungeon Portal via Railway from `dcv01` and verify runtime health.

---

## Active Branch

- `dcv01`

---

## What We Are Working On Right Now

- [ ] Confirm Railway deploy succeeds from `dcv01` and app boots.
- [ ] Review Edge runtime warnings from Supabase middleware and decide on mitigation.
- [ ] Verify story assets load from `story/` after directory consolidation.

---

## Next Small Deliverables

- Railway deploy report (build logs + runtime notes).
- Follow-up fixes for Edge warnings if required.
- Confirmation that story assets and cache limits behave in prod.

---

## Notes / Scratchpad

- Track whether Railway needs environment variables or build overrides.
