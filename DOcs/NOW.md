# NOW - Working Memory (WM)

> This file captures the **current focus / sprint**.  
> It should always describe what we're doing *right now*.

<!-- SUMMARY_START -->
**Current Focus (auto-maintained by Agent):**
- Verify spell roll tracking now drives the Dice Tray after spell casts.
- Validate the split left/right sidebar layout (desktop + mobile drawers).
- Validate Railway deploy from `dcv01` with the latest engine changes.
<!-- SUMMARY_END -->

## Current Objective

Ship the latest `dcv01` build, verify the dice tray + sidebar UX changes, and confirm runtime health.

## Active Branch

- `dcv01`

## What We Are Working On Right Now

- [ ] Confirm Dice Tray displays spell attack/save rolls in live combat.
- [ ] Review split sidebar layout on desktop and mobile; adjust if any crowding remains.
- [ ] Confirm Railway deploy succeeds from `dcv01` and app boots with the latest changes.

---

## Next Small Deliverables

- Railway deploy report (build logs + runtime notes).
- Dice tray + sidebar UX validation notes.
- Follow-up fixes for Edge warnings if required.

---

## Notes / Scratchpad

- Track whether Railway needs environment variables or build overrides.
