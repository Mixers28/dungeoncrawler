# NOW - Working Memory (WM)

> This file captures the **current focus / sprint**.  
> It should always describe what we're doing *right now*.

<!-- SUMMARY_START -->
**Current Focus (auto-maintained by Agent):**
- Complete mechanics overlay coverage and wire data-driven spell resolution.
- Ship Phase 1 branching story progression and validate player choices.
- Validate Railway deploy from `dcv01` with the latest engine changes.
<!-- SUMMARY_END -->

## Current Objective

Ship the latest `dcv01` build with mechanics overlay + branching story updates, and verify runtime health.

---

## Active Branch

- `dcv01`

---

## What We Are Working On Right Now

- [ ] Expand mechanics overlay coverage for missing spells and add name aliases where needed.
- [ ] Wire Phase 1 branching story scenes and validate gated side paths.
- [ ] Confirm Railway deploy succeeds from `dcv01` and app boots with the latest changes.

---

## Next Small Deliverables

- Railway deploy report (build logs + runtime notes).
- Confirmation that branching story paths and gates behave in prod.
- Follow-up fixes for Edge warnings if required.

---

## Notes / Scratchpad

- Track whether Railway needs environment variables or build overrides.
