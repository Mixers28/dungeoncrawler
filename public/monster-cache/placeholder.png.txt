This is a placeholder for the monster placeholder image.
To add a proper placeholder:
1. Create a simple 512x512 silhouette PNG (gray creature shape on transparent background)
2. Save as public/monster-cache/placeholder.png
3. Delete this .txt file

For now, the game will gracefully handle missing images with empty state or default styling.
